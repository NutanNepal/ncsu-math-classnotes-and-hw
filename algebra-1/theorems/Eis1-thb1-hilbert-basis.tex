\begin{thm}[Hilbert Basis Theorem]
    \label{hilbertbasis}
    If a ring $R$ is Noetherian, then the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is Noetherian.
\end{thm}
\begin{cor}
    \label{hilbertbasiscor1}
    Any homomorphic image of a Noetherian ring is Noetherian. Furthermore, if $R_0$ is
    a Noetherian ring, and $R$ is a finitely generated algebra over $R_0$, then $R$ is
    Noetherian.
\end{cor}
\begin{prop}
    \label{hilbertbasisprop1}
    If $R$ is a Noetherian ring and $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, then M is
    Noetherian.
\end{prop}
