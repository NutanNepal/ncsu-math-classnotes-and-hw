    Show that $l^{\infty}$ is not separable.
}

\begin{solution}
    Let $x=\{x_i\}_{i=0}^\infty$ be the sequence
    of zeros and ones. Then since the sequence
    is bounded, it is in $l^\infty$. Now we
    will show that the set of such sequences $x$
    are uncountably many and have disjoint
    open neighborhoods for some radius.

    For each sequence $x$ we associate a real
    number $y$ whose binary
    representation is
    $$\sum_1^{\infty}{\frac{x_i}{2^i}}.$$
    Then for each $y\in [0,1]$, there exists
    a unique sequence of zeros and ones as each
    $y$ has a unique binary representation. Since
    there are uncountably many $y$, the sequences
    associated with them are also uncountable.
    The metric on $l^\infty$ given by
    $$d(x,y)=\sup_{i\in \mathbb{N}}{|x_i-y_i|}$$
    implies that any two distict binary sequences
    $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^\infty$ must be 1 distance
    apart. Then we can take $r=1/2$ to get the
    disjoint neighborhoods in $l^\infty$
    associated with each sequence
    $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^\infty$.

    \vspace*{3mm}
    Now, if $M$ is any dense set in $l^\infty$,
    then every open set in $l^\infty$ must contain
    a point of $M$. So, for each disjoint
    open neighborhood constructed above, $M$
    contains a point in the neighborhood. Hence,
    any dense set $M$ is uncountable in $l^\infty$
    and $l^\infty$ is not separable.
