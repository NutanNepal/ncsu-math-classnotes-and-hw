\question{
    Let $(X, \rho)$ and $(Y, \sigma)$ be metric spaces,
    and let $f: (X, \rho) \to (Y, \sigma)$ be a map
    such that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$, for all
    $V$ open in $Y$. Show that $f$ is continuous on $X$. 
}

\begin{solution}
    Let $V$ be the open set around the image $f(x)$ of a
    point $x\in X$. Then there exists an open set $f^{-1}
    (V)\in X$ such that $x\in f^{-1}(V)$.
    Let $V$ be the open ball
    $B_{x,\varepsilon}(f(x))$ around the point $f(x)$
    for some given $\varepsilon>0$.
    Then $f^{-1}(B_{x,\varepsilon}(f(x)))$ is also open in
    $X$. Since $x$ is in the open set
    $f^{-1}(B_{x,\varepsilon}(f(x)))$, we can find a
    $\delta>0$ such that $x\in B_\delta(x)\subset
    f^{-1}(B_{x,\varepsilon}(f(x)))$. This means that
    for all $z\in X$ such that
    $d(z,x)<\delta$ we have $d(f(z),f(x))<\varepsilon$.
    Hence $f$ is continuous a4 $x$. Since we can
    do this at every point $x\in X$, we see that $f$ is
    continuous on $X$.
