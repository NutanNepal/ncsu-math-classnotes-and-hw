\question{
    Show that the discrete metric space $(X,d)$ is
    separable iff $X$ is countable. 
}

\begin{solution}
    If $X$ is countable, then $X$ is the countable
    dense subset in $X$. So, it is separable.

    Now, we show that if $(X,d)$ is separable, then
    it is countable. Let $Y\subset X$ be
    the countable dense subset of $X$.
    Then every open set of $X$ must contain a point
    from $Y$. We note that all the singleton sets of
    $X$ are open in $X$ and so Y must contain all the
    points from the singleton sets. Hence we get
    $X\subset Y\implies X=Y$. So, $X$ is countable.
