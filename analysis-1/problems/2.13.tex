\question{
    Prove that $(\mQ, d(x,y) = |x-y|)$ is incomplete.
}

\begin{solution}
    We take the sequence $\{x_n\}_1^\infty$ of rational
    numbers given by
    $x_n=\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$. Note that this
    is a convergent sequence in $\rl$ with the same
    metric and hence it is
    Cauchy in $\mQ$ too. However, it does not converge
    to any number in $\mQ$. So, $\mQ$ is not complete.
