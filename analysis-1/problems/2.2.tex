\question{
    ({\bf Continuous mapping}) Show that a
    mapping $T: X\to Y$ is continuous
    if and only if the inverse image of any closed
    set $M\subset Y$ is a closed
    set in $X$.
}

\begin{solution}
    We first note that for any set $A\subset Y$,
    $f^{-1}(A)=\{x\in X:\ f(x)\in A\}$ and
    $f^{-1}(Y\char`\\A)=\{x\in X:\ f(x) \notin A\}$.
    Then clearly, $f^{-1}(A)$ and $f^{-1}(Y\char`\\A)$
    are disjoint sets of $X$. Particularly,
    $$f^{-1}(Y\char`\\A)=X\char`\\f^{-1}(A).$$

    Let $V$ be a closed set of $Y$. Then there exists
    a closed set $f^{-1}(V)$ in  $X$. Since all open
    sets can be written as a complement of closed set,
    we see that for any open set $Y\char`\\V$ in $Y$
    there exists an open set $X\char`\\f^{-1}(V)$ in
    $X$. Since $X\char`\\f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}(Y\char`\\A)$,
    the preimage of any open set of $Y$ is open in
    $X$. Hence $f$ is continuous.
