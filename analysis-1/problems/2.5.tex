    Show that $l^p$, with $1 \leq p <
    \infty$ is separable.
}

\begin{solution}
    We will show that the set $M$ of sequences in $l^p$
    with finite non-zero rational terms is
    the countable dense
    subset of $l^p$ with $1\leq p<\infty$. That is
    $M$ has all the sequences $x$ of the form
    $$(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n,0,0,\ldots)$$
    with each $x_i\in\mQ$.
    First, we show
    that $M$ is countable. Note that for a fixed $n$, the
    set of sequences in $l^p$ with rational terms
    and all but the first $n$
    terms zero is countable. Then $M$ is the countable
    union of countable sets and, hence, is countable.

    Now, we show that the set $M$ is dense in $l^p$
    with $1 \leq p <\infty$. Let $x=\{x_i\}_1^\infty
    \in l^p$. Then $\sum_1^\infty{|x_i|^p}$ is
    convergent and so for every
    $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such
    that,
    $$\sum_{N+1}^\infty{|x_i|^p}<\varepsilon^p/2.$$
    Then, for the first $N$ terms, since rational numbers
    are dense in $\mR$, we can choose rational numbers
    $y_i$ such that $|x_i-y_i|^p<\varepsilon^p/2N$.
    So $(y_1,\ldots,y_N,0,0,\ldots)$ is a point in $M$ and
    we see that
    $$d(x,y)=\left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty{|x_i-y_i|^p}\right)
    ^{1/p}=\left(\sum_{i=1}^N{|x_i-y_i|^p}
    +\sum_{i=N+1}^\infty{|x_i-y_i|^p}\right)
    ^{1/p}<(\varepsilon^p/2+\varepsilon^p/2)^{1/p}
    =\varepsilon$$
    So, for every $\varepsilon>0$, we can find a point
    of $M$ in the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of every
    point $x\in l^p$. Hence $l^p$ with
    $1 \leq p <\infty$ is separable.
