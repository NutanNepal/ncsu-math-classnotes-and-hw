\question{
    Assume that $f : (\mR^2, d_1 =  \
    \text{Euclidean metric}) \to \mR$ is continuous at
    $x \in \mR^2$. Show that
    $f : (\mR^2, d_2 =  \ \text{taxicab metric})
    \to \mR$ is also continuous at $x$.
}

\begin{solution}
    Since $f : (\mR^2, d_1 =  \
    \text{Euclidean metric}) \to \mR$ is continuous,
    we know that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\rl^2$, for all
    $V$ open in $\rl$. Our proof will be complete if we
    can show that every open set $U$ in $(\rl^2,d_1)$
    is also
    open with respect to the taxicab metric.

    Let $V$ be open in $(\mR^2, d_1)$. Then for
    every point $(p,q)\in X$ there exists an open ball
    $B_\delta((p,q))\subset V$ containing $(p,q)$.
    $$B_\delta((p,q))=\{(x,y)\in\mR^2:
    \ (x-p)^2+(y-q)^2<\delta^2\}$$
