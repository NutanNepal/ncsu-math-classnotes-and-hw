\begin{thm}[]
    \label{determinanttrick}
    Suppose that $M$ is an $A-$module generated by n elements and $\phi\in\text{Hom}_{A}(M,M)$;
    let $I$ be an ideal of $A$ such that $\phi(M)\subset IM$. Then there is a relation of the form\\
    \hspace*{10mm}$\phi^n+a_1\phi^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}\phi+a_n=0,$\\
    with $a_i\in I^i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$.
