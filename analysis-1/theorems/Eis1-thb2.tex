\begin{cor}
    \label{invariantsfiniteness}
    Let $k$ be a field, $S=k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]$ be a polynomial ring graded by degree, and $R$ a $k$-subalgebra
    of $S$. If $R$ is a summand of $S$, in the sense that there is a map of $R$-modules $\varphi:S\to R$ that
    preserves degrees and takes each element of $R$ to itself, then $R$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra.
