    Show that a function $f : X \to Y$ between sets is
invertible if and only if it is bijective.

}

\begin{solution}
    A function $f:X\to Y$ is invertible if there exists a
  function $g:Y\to X$ such that $f\circ g= \id_Y$ and
  $g\circ f=\id_X$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[i.]
      $f$ invertible $\implies$ $f$ bijective\\
      Note that since $\id_Y$ is surjective, $f$ must be
      surjective. Now for injectivity, we observe that
      if $f(x) =f(y)$ then $$x=(g\circ f)(x)
      =g(f(x))=g(f(y))=(g\circ f)(y)=y.$$
      Hence, $f$ is bijective.
    \item[ii.]
      $f$ bijective $\implies$ $f$ invertible\\
      Since $f$ is both injective and surjective,
      we define a function $g:Y\to X$ by
      $g(y)=x$ for $y\in Y$
      whenever $f(x)=y$. Note that $g$ is 
      well-defined since there exists only one $y$ for
      each $x$. Then, for all
      $x\in X$,
      $g(f(x)) = g(y)=x \implies g\circ f=\id_X$.
      Similarly, for all $y\in Y$, $f(g(y))=f(x)=y
      \implies f\circ g=\id_Y$. So, $f$ is invertible.
  \end{enumerate}
