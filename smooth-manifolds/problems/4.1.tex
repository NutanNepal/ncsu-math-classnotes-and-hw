\question{
    Precisely specify a function $f$ and an 
element $c$ of the codomain of $f$ such that
the level set of $f$ at
level $c$ is the ellipsoid in
$\rl^3$ defined by the equation
$$x^2+2y^2+3z^2=4.$$
}

\begin{solution}
    The given equation is the level set of
    the function $f:\rl^3\to\rl$ given by
    $$f(x,y,z)=x^2+2y^2+3z^2$$
    at level $c=4$.
\end{solution}
