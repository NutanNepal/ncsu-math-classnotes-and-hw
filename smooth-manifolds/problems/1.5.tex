    Show that the product topology on a product
$X \times Y$ of topological spaces is a valid
topology.

}
\begin{solution}
    $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces.
  We define a set $U\subset X\times Y$ to be open if
  for all $(x,y)\in U$ we have open neighborhoods $U_x
  \subset X$ and $U_y\subset Y$ such that
  $U_x\times U_y\subset U$.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[i.] Clearly the null set $\phi$ and the whole set
      $X\times Y$ are open since $X$ is open in $X$ and
      $Y$ is open in $Y$.

    \item[ii.] Arbitrary union $\bigcup
    {U_\alpha}$ of open sets is open.
    
    \setlength{\parskip}{2mm}
    Let $(x,y)$ be an
    arbitrary point in $\bigcup{U_\alpha}$, then
    $(x,y)\in U_i$ for some $i$. Then, by definition,
    there are open neighborhoods $U_x
    \subset X$ and $U_y\subset Y$ such that
    $U_x\times U_y\subset U_i \subset \bigcup{U_\alpha}$.

    \item[iii.] Finite intersection $U_i\cap U_j$ of
      open sets is open.
      
      \setlength{\parskip}{2mm}
      Let $(x,y)$ be an arbitrary
      point of $U_i\cap U_j$, then $(x,y)\in U_i$ and
      $(x,y)\in U_j$. Then, by definition,
      there are open neighborhoods $U_{ix}, U_{jx}
      \subset X$ and $U_{iy}, U_{jy}\subset Y$ such that
      $U_{ix}\times U_{iy}\subset U_i$ and
      $U_{jx}\times U_{jy}\subset U_j$. Then
      $$U_i\cap U_j
      \supset \left(U_{ix}\times U_{iy}\right)
      \cap\left(U_{jx}\times U_{jy}\right)
      =\left(U_{ix}\cap U_{jx}\right)
      \times\left(U_{iy}\cap U_{jy}\right)
      \ni (x,y).$$
      Since $\left(U_{ix}\times U_{jx}\right)$
      and $\left(U_{iy}\times U_{jy}\right)$ are open
      in $X$ and $Y$ respectively, we see that
      $U_i \cap U_j$ is open.

  \end{enumerate}
