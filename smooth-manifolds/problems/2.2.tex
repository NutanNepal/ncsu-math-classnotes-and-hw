\question{
    Do Exercise 2.7 (show that the product topology
    and the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$ agree).
}

\begin{solution}
    Suppose $\mathscr{P}$ be the product topology and
    $\mathscr{T}$ be the usual topology in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    Let $U$ be open in the product topology, then
    for all $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in U$ there exists 
    open neighborhoods $U_i\in \mathbb{R}$ such that
    $x_i\in U_i$ and $U_1\times \cdots 
    \times U_n \subset U$. Then for all $x_i$, there
    exists an open interval $(x_i-\delta_i,x_i+\delta_i)$
    for some $\delta_i>0$.
    Let $\delta=\min\{\delta_i\}$ taken over
    all $i$ from 1 to $n$. Clearly, $\delta>0$  and 
    $x\in B_\delta(x)\subset U_1\times \cdots 
    \times U_n \subset U$. This shows that
    $\mathscr{P}\subset \mathscr{T}$.

    Now let $U$ be open with respect to the usual
    topology. Then for all $x\in U$, there exists an
    open ball $B_\delta(x)$ containing $x$ such that
    $B_\delta(x)\subset U$ for some $\delta>0$.
    Let $\delta_i = \delta/\sqrt{2}$. Then each $x_i$
    is contained in the interval
    $U_i= (x_i-\delta_i,x_i+\delta_i)$ and we see that
    $B_\delta(x) \supset U_1\times \cdots 
    \times U_n$. Then $x\in U_1\times \cdots 
    \times U_n \subset B_\delta(x) \subset U$. Hence
    $U$ is open in the product topology and
     $\mathscr{P}\supset \mathscr{T}$. So we see that the
     two topologies agree.
