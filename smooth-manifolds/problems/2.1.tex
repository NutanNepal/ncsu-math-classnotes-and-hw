    Do Exercise 2.6 (show that for topological spaces
    $X$, $Y$, $Z$, the “rearrange-the-parentheses” map
    from $(X\times Y)\times Z$ to $X\times(Y\times Z)$
    is a homeomorphism).
}

\begin{solution}
    Let the function $f:(X\times Y)\times Z \to 
X\times(Y\times Z)$ be defined as
$$f((x,y),z)=f(x,(y,z))$$
where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are respective points of
the topological spaces. We see that the map is
clearly bijective and hence invertible.

Now, for each open set $U_x\times (U_y\times U_z)$,
the preimage of $f$
is given by $(U_x\times U_y)\times U_z$
which is open in $(X\times Y)\times Z$. Similarly,
for each open set $(U_x\times U_y)\times U_z$,
the preimage of $f^{-1}$
is given by $U_x\times (U_y\times U_z)$
which is open in $X\times (Y\times Z)$.
Hence $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are both continuous and the
"rearrange the parentheses" map is homeomorphism.
