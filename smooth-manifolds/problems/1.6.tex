\question{
    Verify the three basic properties of closed sets
that correspond to the three axioms for open sets.
}
\begin{solution}
    We define a set $V\subset X$ to be closed if its
  complement $V^c$ is open in $X$.

  \setlength{\parskip}{2mm}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[i.] The null set $\phi$ and the whole set
      $X$ are closed.

      \setlength{\parskip}{2mm}
      $\phi^c=X$ and $X^c=\phi$ which are open in $X$.
    \item[ii.] Arbitrary intersection $\bigcap{V_\alpha}$
      of closed sets is closed.

      \setlength{\parskip}{2mm}
      Here we use the set-theoretic fact that
      \begin{equation}
        \left(\bigcup U_\beta\right)^c=
      \bigcap U_\beta^c \label{setfact}
      \end{equation}
      where $\{U_\beta\}$ is the collection of
      indexed sets. Since each sets $V_\alpha$
      are closed, we write $V_\alpha$ as $U_\alpha^c$
      where $U_\alpha$ is an open set of $X$.
      Then from \ref{setfact} we have
      \begin{equation}
        \bigcap V_\alpha=\bigcap U_\alpha^c=
        \left(\bigcup U_\alpha\right)^c
      \end{equation}
      Hence, since $\bigcup U_\alpha$ is open in $X$,
      $\bigcap V_\alpha$ must be closed.

      \item[iii.] Finite union $V_i\cup V_j$ of closed sets
        is closed.

        \setlength{\parskip}{3mm}
         We have $V_i\cup V_j=U_i^c\cup U_j^c=(U_i\cap U_j)
         ^c$. Since finite intersection of open sets are
         open, we observe that $V_i\cup V_j$ is the complement
         of an open set. Hence $V_i\cup V_j$ is closed.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
