\question{
    Precisely specify a function $f$ and an
element $c$ of the codomain of $f$ such that the
level set of $f$ at
level $c$ is the graph of
\begin{align*}
    &g:\rl^2\to\rl\\
    &g(x,y)=x^3-y^4.
\end{align*}
}

\begin{solution}
    The graph of $g$ is given by the set
    $$\{(x,y,z)\in\rl^3:\ z=x^3-y^4\}.$$
    Then, this graph of $g$ is the level
    set of the function $f:\rl^3\to\rl$
    given by
    $$f(x,y,z)=x^3-y^4-z$$
    at level $c=0$.
\end{solution}
