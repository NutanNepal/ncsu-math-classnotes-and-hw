\question{
    Precisely specify a function $f$ whose image
is the line in $\rl^3$ defined by the system
of equations
$$\begin{dcases*}
    y=2;\\
    x-3z=5.
\end{dcases*}
$$
}

\begin{solution}
    In the given line, the second coordinate
    is always 2 and the first coordinate can be
    written as a function of the third coordinate
    as $x=5+3z$. Then, the function $f:\rl\to\rl^3$
    defined as
    $$f(x)=(5+3x,2,x)$$ has the given line as
    its image.
\end{solution}
