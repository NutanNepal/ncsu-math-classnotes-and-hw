\question{
    Show that a composition of continuous functions
$\rl^n\xrightarrow{f}\rl^m\xrightarrow{g}\rl^k$ is continuous.
}

\begin{solution}
    Since $g$ is continuous, we have $g^{-1}(V)$ open for
  all open set $V\subset \rl^k$. Similarly we have $f$
  continuous, so $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for all open sets
  $U\subset \rl^m$. Then, $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(V))=
  (g\circ f)^{-1}(V)$ is open for all open sets $V$ in
  $\rl^k$. Hence the composition is continuous.

\end{solution}
