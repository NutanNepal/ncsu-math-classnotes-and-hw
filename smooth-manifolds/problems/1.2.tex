\question{
    Prove the second part of Proposition 2.17
 (a function $f : \rl^n\to \rl^m$ is continuous
 everywhere if and only if for all open subsets
 $V$ of $\rl^m$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ of $V$
 under $f$ is open in $\rl^n$).
}

\begin{solution}
  The Proposition 2.17 is reproduced below:

  Let $f:\rl^n\to\rl^m$ be a function and let $p\in\rl^n$.
  Let $q = f (p)$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[i.] $f$ is continuous at $p$ if and only if
    for any open neighborhood $V$ of $q$ in
    $\rl^m$, the preimage of $V$ under $f$
    (i.e. $f^{-1}(V )$) contains an open subset
    $U$ of $\rl^n$ which in turn contains $p$,
    i.e. there is some open neighborhood
    $U$ of $p\in\rl^n$ such that $f$ sends $U$ inside $V$ .

  \item[ii.] $f$ is continuous (everywhere) if and
    only if for any open subset $V$ of
    $\rl^m$, the preimage of V under f
    (i.e. $f^{-1}(V )$) is an open subset of $\rl^n$.
    
\end{enumerate}

  For $\Leftarrow$ : If for all open subsets
  $V$ of $\rl^m$ the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ of $V$
  under $f$ is open in $\rl^n$, then $f$ is continuous.

  Let $V\subset \rl^m$ be an open subset such that
  $f(x)\in V$. Then we have an open disk
  $D_{\epsilon}(f(x)) \subset V$.
  As the disk $D_{\epsilon}(f(x))$ is open
  in $\rl^m$, we have the preimage
  $f^{-1}(D_{\epsilon}(f(x)))
  \subset \rl^n$ which is open and
  contains $x$. Then we can find
  a $\delta>0$ such that
  $D_{\delta}(x)\subset f^{-1}(D_{\epsilon}(f(x)))$.
  That is, for every $\epsilon$-ball around $f(x)$,
  we can find a $\delta$-ball around $x$ such that
  $$y\in D_{\delta}(x)\implies f(y)\in D_{\epsilon}(f(x))$$
  for some $y$. Hence $f$ is continuous.
